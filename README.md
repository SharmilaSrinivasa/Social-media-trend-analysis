# Social-media-trend-analysis
Data mining project

An improvement is proposed to an original pipeline to include data cleaning, network analysis, and a method for
community detection. It integrates domain expert feedback on relevant phrases to create n-grams to include in the
community model. The community model create groupings based on collections of topic profiles. A post processing
module identifies influencers in respective communities as well as topics of those communities. Visualizations are
provided to assess baseline communities.

The case study for this data research pipeline will use Twitter data to model people links and events around the
#MeToo conversation within the past years. 

Tools:  
EDA: Juptyer, Scikit-learn, Gensim, python-louvain, natural language tool kit.       
Data pipeline: MongoDB.       
Models: Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Louvain modeling method.
